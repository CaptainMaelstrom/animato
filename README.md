animato
=======

animato is a program made with love2d that let's anyone create animations based on in-betweening ('tweening') between various keyframes. The workflow is roughly this:

1. Replace the images in the images folder with those of your own
2. Open animato and duplicate/remove images until you have the ones you need for your animation
3. Click and drag images and make the next keyframe (by pressing 'k')
4. Press play to watch your images transform from one keyframe to another (press 'p' to play)

Save your animation to a file by pressing Ctrl+S and entering a name

Changing the draw order
-----------------------

By default, animato will draw each image in the order it was loaded. This may not be satisfactory--to change the order, start by pressing the 'n' key. This will clear the current draw order and you will see all of your images greyed out.
Now click on each image in the order you'd like animato to draw them. They will turn white as you click them. When you're happy and have clicked all the images, press 'm' to set the draw order.
